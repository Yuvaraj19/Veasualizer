# Veasualizer

Veasualizer is a modern data visualization and a “ML” tool. Using Veasualizer a user with zero knowledge can make beautiful visualizations: Graphs and plots. Not just that, Veasualizer has features using which users can Train, Test and Draw predictions from data by just uploading their dataset to Veasualizer. After uploading dataset, User will have freedom to choose different algorithms suitable for their data and can even choose different parameters for training the dataset on which accuracy of the model depends on. At the end user will get an Exploratory Data Analysis Report (EDA) for their dataset. 
Our main objective of Veasualize is to make stuff, which is complex, look easy and useful to everybody. Just by some clicks and uploading datasets, Users will be able to plot different plots like: Scatter plot, Bar graphs, Bubble plots, Box plots, Dot plots, Pie charts and more. And ML algorithms include Regression and Classification algorithms like: Linear, Polynomial, Logistic etc.
